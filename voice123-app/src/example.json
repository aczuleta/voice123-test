(a specific keyword search just brings up our name and first \"main\" demo tied to the key search words you probably used.)  Chances are, what you're looking for is on one my specific demos to the right and on down the page.  If you like what you hear PLEASE add me to your preferred Voices for future castings!\n\nIf you’re an industry pro you can probably skip down several paragraphs.   If you’re here because you liked what you heard on my demo and are mainly curious about the cost then I might not be the talent you’re looking for.\n\nTo me, every Voiceover is a performance.  It’s not a “commodity” to be measured, quantified and “priced” by how many words it is or long it is.  If that was the case then why ask for a bunch of auditions and listen to them and choose one based on what?  Ah yes the performance.  The ability to draw you in, convince you, entertain and inform you.  All because one of those “performances” just some how just sounds better than the others right?  Okay great Steve but what is this going to cost?  Well let’s start with a good reference link to copy & paste and bookmark for future budgeting considerations to help you understand what Professional Voice Talents are getting for good and GREAT performances today.\n\nhttp://www.globalvoiceacademy.com/gvaa-rate-guide/\n\nProfessional Voiceover performances are priced by use (where they will be seen and or heard) and for how long it will be used.  “In Perpetuity” is a long time.  That should be worth some thing.  You don’t want to be the Voice talent who agrees to be the voice of something in perpetuity for $500 only to discover that you are now frozen out of that specific category for the rest of your life.\n\nI realize that sometimes you, the Voice-caster, Producer or Director may like the \"sound\" of a voice on a demo.  But wonder how they will \"sound\" with your projects \"voice\" you hear in your head.  That's why I also offer FREE coached or directed auditions via Source Connect, iPDTL, ISDN, Skype or Phone patch.  Saving us both time.  Again it's FREE why not kick things around it's only going to cost you your time?   Also if you can share with me which clip or part of my demo you liked and \"hear\" your copy or project being read/delivered in the same manner that is VERY helpful!\n\nThe great thing is that there are thousands people offering voice over.  If price is your sole concern and it’s simply a commodity to you, I’m sure you can find someone here.  But will they be available three months from now when you need to change out a line of copy and will it match the previous performance for sound quality and style?  Will they be able to get that audio back to you that same day?  Will they be able to offer copy change ideas on the spot based on YEARS of experience to help keep your project moving forward and on time?  This is not a side hobby for me.  It’s a full time love affair.  I travel with a studio matching go bag so my clients are never without audio.  And I’ve recorded thousands of punches and pickups from some crazy locations, just ask my wife. And yes that includes while on vacation and the Holidays.\n\nI’m also constantly honing my craft and skills.  I train and coach with people like Marice Tobias, Mary Lynn Wissner, Harry Dunn and Jodi Gottlieb.  Google their names and you’ll see why.\n\nWe’ve lived in Dallas, Miami to Minneapolis but growing up in the midwest, married to a farmers daughter I haven’t lost my small town work ethic.   On the other hand I've got a couple decades of life experiences I try to use in my reads, like Carrier landing on the deck of the U.S.S. Enterprise, snorkeling with black tip sharks to having narrowly escaped being duct taped, naked and upside down to an AUTEC Island Palm tree by U.S. Special forces! (true story ask me to explain what happened and why “air traffic Controllers” need to be respected)\n\nAs a professional stand up comic and Moth Story Telling performer, I have a keen ear for tones that perfectly lends itself to produce natural sounding accents that will fit perfectly into your documentary, narration, commercial, eLearning Module, or International Corporate Trainings. I am also especially adept at impersonating and emulating voices and personalities. I strive to create characters whose sound captures the feel and culture of that specific voice.\n\nMy home and road studio has iPDTL, ISDN, Source Connect, Phone Patching and Skype.  It's also portable thanks to my Apollo twin and UA plugin technology. \n\nI do VO for Commercials, Visual Messaging, Explainer Videos, WhiteBoard Videos, Instructional, DRTV, How to videos, DIY, web page landing videos, Sizzle reels, long form narration.  Name it and I’ve probably done it.\n\nI understand that your life is busy and you need someone who can deliver the right reads, perfect quality, and prompt service THE FIRST TIME.  I absolutely LOVE what I do and it’s provided an amazing life for me because I deliver amazing Customer Service\n\nLet me help you TELL YOUR STORY, whether it's in 10 seconds, 10 minutes or more.  I can give you a variety of different styles and emotions to match whatever you're going for.  Check out my many different Vimeo VO demos from actual clients I work with every day right here https://vimeo.com/steveketvo  Producers say that I take direction well.  If you want we can phone patch, Skype, Source Connect or ISDN together right into my booth in real time and create that “sound” you hear in your head right now it’s absolutely FREE and doesn’t cost extra.  If time permits I’m usually up for a FREE scratch read that you can drop into your pitch.\n\nI know how frustrating it can be when people don't return your phone calls or emails.  I don't do that. \n\nYOU ARE A REAL PERSON to me. I know you've got deadlines and people you’re answering to!  I can promise to deliver your recording within 24 HOURS usually within hours. My rates are competitive and I’ll give you CLEAR COMMUNICATION throughout. My studio is state of the art and I even travel with a matching portable studio “go bag” with my Universal Audio Apollo Gears’ little brother the Apollo Twin and matching Sennheiser 416 mic.   My goal is to build a long term relationship built on a trust that you know I can deliver what you need when you need it. \n\nIf you are looking for a friendly, professional, experienced, easy to work with and dependable voice for your next campaign please contact me.  For booking information or just to ask a simple question, email me at: ketvoice@gmail.com  call 561-628-8552 or check out www.steveket.com.\n\nWhy did I reference voiceover beach way at the beginning of this conversation?  Because I live and work and a very beautiful part of the world that you can explore at this link\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/voiceoverbeach/\n\nVOICE STYLE/TYPE\n\n*CONVERSATIONAL - REAL - GUY NEXT DOOR - VERSATILE VOICE-* I have a warm approachable, friendly voice that pleasantly resonates in both higher and lower registers, producing a natural sound that audiences quickly trust. Many producers say I have a nice Alec Baldwin meets Kevin Bacon tone/sound. \n\nSteve is consistently cast for a wide range of age requirements . . . male 20's, 30's, 40's, and 50's (25-54).\n\nMy voiceover reads have been described as friendly, genuine, authentic, believable, guy next door, high energy, hard sell, soft sell, sincere, cool, hip, caring, corporate, compelling, story teller, relatable, smart, knowledgeable, sophisticated, urgent and educational.\n\nMy voice is strong but also versatile, allowing me to boldly and confidently deliver strong passionate messages, or softly narrate and tell a story that keeps listeners feeling comfortable and engaged. Whether you are producing a commercial with Dennis Leary style attitude or believable Matt Damon confidence, A deadpan Nick Offerman to a documentary, a movie trailer, a cartoon pilot, an internet release, a product demo, an explainer demo, a corporate piece for use internally or with clients, or even your company's automated telephone attendant, I have the experience and versatility to bring your script to life. Whether that be a natural Guy Next Door neighbor, Middle Age Corporate Trainer, or Wise Old Man, I will deliver the performance you want. I even do spot on impressions. If you need one of the Simpsons to President trump to an ex president, Dennis Leary attitude, a Jon Hamm style or John Corbett style read, A Ray Ramano, easy going guy, Jack Nicholsen or that Movie Trailer voice Don La Fontaine delivery, ask me for a custom demo of your script\n\nTESTIMONIALS \nI had the pleasure of working with Steve Ket on a project called “ERP FrankenCloud”. Steve managed to create a version of Dr. Frankenstein that struck the right tone of mad scientist, technology visionary and despondent business leader – all in an Elizabethan tone. I was nervous that someone could even pull this off. He not only nailed it, but he offered a range of options to pick from. And he could repeat it with each edit and new job we asked of him. His turn around was fast, he took direction well and added value at ever turn. All in all, Steve Ket is a real professional with amazing range -- I highly recommend him. \n\nSteve Casey \nMarketing Communications & Creative Director\nFinancialForce.com\n\nPhase 3 Films - Orange California Working with Steve was awesome.  His flexibility, versatility and commitment to getting the spot just right made things run as smooth as silk.  He is at the top of my callback list.  Todd Yates Director  \n\nSouthern Pride Cookers We were looking for an authoritative voice that would appeal to men and women in the foodservice industry.  Steve's voice was an instant choice after our exhausting search.  Once we made communication, the project was complete in less than 24 hours and he absolutely nailed it on the first pass.  Excellent work Steve!  Thanks for making us look so good.  \n\nPrudential Securities \"I was fortunate to find Steve, he exceeded my expectations in every possible way. Steve was professional, courteous, and did a terrific job, and even turned around work very quickly over the holidays. I would recommend Steve to anyone looking for professional voiceover work done quickly, and professionally!\"    \n\n***** \"Steve is an amazing talent to work with; his rich and engaging voice will turn heads every time.  He goes the extra mile to make certain he understands exactly what it is that is needed.  Pickups, if any, are swift and perfect.  I will happily work with him again.\" -Shawna Cook Lab51 Media Creative Lead",
